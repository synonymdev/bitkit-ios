# Git and GitHub Rules (CRITICAL)

## NEVER create, submit, or push pull requests (PRs) to any GitHub organization except BitcoinErrorLog.

- NEVER push code, commits, or branches to synonymdev or any other organization
- ONLY push to remotes that point to BitcoinErrorLog (e.g., `fork` remote pointing to `github.com/BitcoinErrorLog/*`)
- When merging PRs from upstream (synonymdev), only merge locally and push to BitcoinErrorLog forks
- NEVER use `gh pr create`, `gh pr comment`, or any GitHub CLI commands that would create/modify PRs outside BitcoinErrorLog
- If unsure about a Git operation, verify the remote URL points to BitcoinErrorLog before pushing
- Always check `git remote -v` before pushing to ensure you're pushing to the correct organization
- Before any git push, verify the remote URL: `git remote get-url <remote-name>` must contain `BitcoinErrorLog`
